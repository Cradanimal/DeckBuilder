There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  MTG Deckbuilder

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  An app were MTG fans can research cards and build templete decks.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  This app gives you a place to research cards and then store a deck as you work on it over time. This way you can organize and build a deck quickly online, so you can see how the cards will work together, before you go to the trouble of physically aquiring them. Access to current and legacy sets. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Its difficult plan a deck you want to build and keep track of all the cards that will be included while researching cards to add.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  MTG Deckbuilder lets you research cards and add them to your deck and then keeps track of them for you so you can update or add cards as you need to.


## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "Finally I can get all the Black Lotuses I need." - Conrad Wimberly (Super-Dork)

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Just type in a search and start adding cards to your deck, its that easy!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Before this I would have to build entire decks in one sitting, MTG Deckbuilder makes it easy for a dumb-dumb like me to compete with all these fourteen year-olds at the card shop." - Area Man

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Check it out at localhost:3000 and start building the deck of your dreams!
